    "All data is from a census data package supported on [GitHub](https://github.com/jtleider/censusdata). Unfortunatley this may be a short-term solution because the package is no longer being supported on GitHub so we may have to find a more long-term solution in the future. For this project, we are using basic demographics so I have found data on sex, age, race, employment status, number of housing units, income, language spoken at home, heatlh insurance status, poverty status. All data is at the census tract level and is either the total count or the average for the tract. The data used for the project is the ACS 5-year from 2018."
