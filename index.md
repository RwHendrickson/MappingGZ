### One sentence description:

Create an interactive web site that promotes environmental justice and highlights the characteristics of the protected municipal Green Zones in Minneapolis.

### Project Outline:

In 2018 the city of Minneapolis and the City Council created the Green Zones to address historical patterns of environmental racism and discriminatory city planning in several underserved communities in the city. These overburdened communities are represented by predominantly low income, immigrant, and Native American populations. The city's sustainability director identified these areas as being disproportionately affected by environmental injustices; evidenced by high hospitalization rates for asthma, increased incidences of cancer, and the highest levels of particulate matter concentration (air pollution) when compared to the metro area and the state. 

The Green Zone initiative intends to give a voice to a community that has been underserved and mistreated for decades; the problem is nobody knows about it. While the zones have been in existence for over 3 years,  access to critical scientific data about the Green Zones  and awareness of the protections remains low. Additionally, the Green Zones struggle with public engagement and organizational accountability from city staff, the Mayor’s office and the City Council. The Green Zone organizing body needs an accessible, transparent, and effective way to gather current data, address community concerns and implement community driven solutions to ongoing injustices. 

We aim to create space for critical engagement by co-creating a set of dynamic and interactive maps with community. The idea is that these maps would record existing injustices in the neighborhood, respond to community-based input, and be continuously evolving in real-time. With this interactive map and dashboard continuously updating, it would make it easier for a community to report back to their government on what is truly happening in their neighborhood and bring transparency to the Southside Green Zones Council. In addition to transparency, the new wealth of knowledge can support in reporting on discriminatory city planning practices, improving accountability. Not only is it our hope to create an interactive map that has tools for all of these components, but we want it to be user-friendly and accessible for the entire community. Without transparency within their own community, the Green Zones will continue to be underserved and ignored and with this new tool it could actually measure the progress the Green Zones are making.
